This is fork of https://github.com/luaj/luaj

It updates the repository to my liking - use maven as the build tool (with multimodule project structure), change source and target version to 1.6 (suits my needs), spaces instead of tabs.

This branch modifies the behaviour to match that of the Lua environment provided by the game Factorio (maybe matching https://github.com/Rseding91/Factorio-Lua )
